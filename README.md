# Spam Detection Project

This project is focused on developing a Spam Detection Model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify text messages as either “spam” or “not spam” based on their content. This model can be applied to email filtering, SMS filtering, or any other scenario where text classification is needed to filter out unwanted or irrelevant content.

Project Overview

	•	Objective: To build a reliable spam detection system capable of accurately identifying spam messages.
	•	Approach: The project uses text preprocessing, feature extraction, and various machine learning algorithms to train and evaluate the model’s performance.
	•	Technologies: This project is developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and nltk are utilized for data handling, feature extraction, and model training.

Key Features

	•	Text Preprocessing: Steps include text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization for optimal feature extraction.
	•	Model Training: Multiple machine learning algorithms are tested to determine the most effective model for spam detection.
	•	Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate model performance.

Usage

To get started, clone this repository, install the required dependencies, and run the provided Jupyter Notebook file to load data, preprocess it, and train the model.
